# Predictive Modeling for Drug Activity Using Binary Classification Techniques

## Project Overview
This repository contains a machine learning project focused on predicting drug activity using various classifiers. The primary objective is to analyze and compare the performance of different classification algorithms on a dataset related to drug activity.

## Repository Contents
- `MultipleClassifiers.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook containing the implementation and analysis of multiple classifiers.
- `Perceptron_lc.png`: Learning curve visualization for the Perceptron classifier.
- `dc_lc.png`: Learning curve visualization for another classifier.

## Features
- **Multiple Classifiers**: Utilizes different machine learning models to predict drug activity.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Compares the effectiveness of each classifier based on various metrics.
- **Visualization**: Includes learning curves and other plots to visually represent the model performance.

**Note**: This code and repository are for showcasing my projects and are not intended for external use.
